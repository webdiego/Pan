### Links

- Live Site URL: [Pan](https://pan-wich-pan.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
My focus of this project was on practising React.
I tried to recreate the website Table with Styled Component instead of using CSS/sass.

I've learned also how it is important to make a good work plan before make any development because in this project, even it was a simple one, I've had issues of doing it as I wanted in the beginning
